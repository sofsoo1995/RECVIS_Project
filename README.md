# 3D human pose estimation

here you can find some scripts or notebook that has been modified for the extension to videos. The code are not executable
A lot of things are missing(library caffe, smpl library...).


Mainly the code comes from :
-https://github.com/ZheC/Realtime_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation
-http://smplify.is.tue.mpg.de/

So each modified files have a different licenses and these files follow the license of the original file.
This modification has been done for a project.

You can also find the videos done using this dataset :
